# Welcome to your Notes App

This is a local-first note-taking application. You can:

- Edit `.mdx` files directly in your code editor
- See changes instantly in the UI
- Search through your notes with full-text search
- Organize notes with tags

## How to Use

1. Create or edit `.mdx` files in the `content/notes` directory
2. Use frontmatter to add metadata like title, date, and tags
3. Write your content in Markdown/MDX format
4. The changes will be reflected immediately in the app

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard Markdown syntax:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists and numbered lists
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

```js
const hello = "world";
console.log(hello);
```

And because this is MDX, you can also use React components directly in your notes!
